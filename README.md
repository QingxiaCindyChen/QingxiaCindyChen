- 👋 Hi, I’m Qingxia 'Cindy' Chen, an Associate Professor at Department of Biostatistics at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. 
- 👀 My research lands on both novel statistical research and impactful biomedical research. Currently, my statistical research focuses on missing data, survival analysis (especially time-varying effect and treatment switching), Bayesian methods in big data, and penalized approach for 1<n/p<10. I also devote time to develop statistical methods in using electronic health records (EHRs) and genetics information in precision medicine. My other significant biomedical research areas include cancer, ophthalmology, infection disease, cardiovascular diseases, and suicide.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning causal inference in EHR.
- 💞️ I welcome collaboration on any of my research topics listed above.
